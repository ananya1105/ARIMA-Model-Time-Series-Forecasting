# ARIMA-Model-Time-Series-Forecasting
I have used ARIMA model for time-series forecasting. The dataset used in the implementation can be accessed from the data folder, alternatively you can also get the data here(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/shampoo.csv).
I have majorly referred to this article for implementation - https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/
Concept of Autocorrelation, used in the project can be best understood from this video(in my opinion :P)-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjaBn93YPWo
